General scripts for sharing across Ashtan
Authors: Otha Le'Murzen

If you enjoy these scripts, please donate a credit or two.

Current scripts:
-Rainbow crits
You can customize the colors if you would like, it is a list inside of the trigger
-Wilderness walkto (currently requires dragon and/or flying)
'gto' is the wilderness walkto command.  Aran'riod is an example within that alias.  In order to add a new path, add a room to enter the wilderness then directions to glide, then walk.  The script will goto room#, enter the wilderness, fly, glide all of the glide directions, walk all of the walk directions, leave wilderness, and land.
